Helping you to consume power when it is clean

Increasing amounts of power are being produced from clean renewable power. However, renewable power is intermittent: it depends on the wind the sun and the waves. Hence, what matters is increasingly not how much energy you consume, but when.

Currently Powbal is in trial mode. We are running experiments with students and staff from Imperial College, LSE and University of Oxford. Below you can see real-time performance indicators of the system
