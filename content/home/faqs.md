# Frequently Asked Questions

## What is POWBAL?

As technologies continue to enhance our everyday lives, we are ever more reliant on electricity. As a result, ensuring we have reliable and clean electricity generation systems in the UK has become an important and challenging goal. One component of the solution is to make our electricity demand more flexible: if we can shift usage that is not time sensitive to times when the wind blows and the sun shines, supplying us with abundant clean energy, it will be cheaper to produce more electricity from such renewable resources. But how do we decide what is time sensitive and how do we shift usage?

Which electricity usage is time sensitive will vary from person to person. With the POWBAL project, we will begin to understand which electricity usage households consider to be time sensitive and when electricity usage is more flexible.

For the duration of the study, participants will be given a free smart plug which can be controlled and monitored remotely via the internet. We will ask you to use this plug for electricity consumption that you deem non-time-sensitive (some examples are provided in the table below). For instance, you could use it to power devices with battery backup (e.g. laptops).

We will use the plug to measure the amount of non-time-sensitive electricity consumption at various times, which allows us to form an understanding of the potential for shifting usage to times when the UK experiences an abundance of power from renewable sources. Once the trial starts, we will switch off the plug from time to time for brief intervals. These switch-off events will show us that whatever you have connected to the plug is indeed not time-sensitive. You will **always** be able to override such a switch-off event either manually via a button on the plug or via the online interface.


## What happens once I sign up?

Once you have consented to participate, please feel free to connect your smart plug to any appliance of your choosing, as you would a travel converter. As mentioned above, this will allow us to measure the amount of non-time-sensitive power consumption at various times, giving us insight into the flexibility of energy consumers’ energy usage. Please note that not everyone in your student hall has received a free smart plug due to research design requirements.

## How long is the study?

Study length will vary depending on when you’ve signed up. For most participants the study will last for a maximum of 12 months, though you may choose to withdraw your participation at any time and may be able to extend participation if you wish to.

## What are the benefits of participation?

In addition to the energy savings and the free smart plug, we will hold regularly scheduled raffles of Tango vouchers every two weeks.

**Rewards:** Rewards come in the form of Tango gift cards, which are currently redeemable to Amazon, Argos, Caffe Nero, Debenhams, Decathlon, Google Play, Halfords, iTunes, John Lewis, Marks & Spencer, New Look, Nike, Pizza Express, Starbucks, Steam Wallet, Tesco, The Great British Pub (i.e. all participating UK pubs), Ticketmaster, TK Maxx, Uber, and Zalanda.

**Raffle procedure:** The rewards distributed depend on the number of participants signed up to the study, where rewards increase with the number of participants[^1]. For instance, if 250 participants take part this year, we will give away approximately £5000 worth of Tango vouchers. In this way, we ensure that more participation does not disadvantage any individual participant. The raffles for these vouchers will be conducted every two weeks. Winners receive vouchers by email.

## Which electronic or appliance should I plug in via my POWBAL plug?

Consuming more power via the smart plug, by plugging your most energy-consuming non-time-sensitive devices into the smart plug (examples below) increases your chances of winning vouchers.

Furthermore, through your participation, the research team carrying out the study will be able to learn more about enhancing energy efficiency in our community, helping you and those around you to save money while contributing to environmental improvements both locally and globally.


## What do I do if my plug is not online?

If your plug is not online, please make sure that (i) it is connected to a socket that is switched on, and (ii) the wifi signal is strong enough near your plug (e.g. by connecting your phone or laptop to the hall wifi network and checking the strength near your plug).


## What about privacy?

All data obtained from participants will be kept confidential and will only be reported in an aggregated and anonymised format. All questionnaires will be concealed, and no one other than the investigators and assistant researchers will have access to them. The data collected will be stored in a secure database until the primary investigator has deleted them. The purpose of the data collection is academic research, and all data collection and storage is in compliance with GDPR regulation.


## Are there any risks to my involvement in the study?

We do not expect any risks or discomforts to arise in this study. However, you can contact us any time at powbal@imperial.ac.uk if you experience any issues. This email address will be monitored daily.


## Can I withdraw my participation if I change my mind?

Participation is completely voluntary, and you have a right to withdraw at any time (or refuse to participate entirely), without penalty or consequences. If you choose to withdraw from the study, you will be asked whether we can use your already collected energy usage data. If you confirm, we will include the data in our analyses. Should you choose to withdraw your consent, we will delete your data from our files and permanently delete your consent form.


## Will someone be available to help if I have questions or concerns during the study?

Yes. You can contact us any time at powbal@imperial.ac.uk. If necessary, a member of the project team can meet with you to discuss issues and concerns as well.  

[^1]: Every two weeks we will hold a raffle where participants can win up to £(10 × number of active participants) in e-vouchers. So assuming we have 250 participants, any participant in any fortnightly raffle can win up to £2500. Chances of winning depend on the amount of load balancing - that is,  electricity consumption through the smart plug that gets displaced during our switch-off events - that an individual resident contributes in the preceding 2-week period. The detailed raffle procedure is as follows: for every participant in our study during those two weeks, we add a voucher worth £10 (i.e. £2500 for our target of 250 participants). Those vouchers will be given away by drawing ‘raffle tickets’, where the number of raffle tickets per participant for these draws is proportional to their load balancing contribution. There is a 10% chance that any given £10 voucher gets allocated to a participant; i.e. 90% of the raffle tickets are ‘blank’. The number of draws every two weeks is equivalent to the number of participants (i.e. 250 in this case), and each raffle ticket gets replaced after each draw. Hence over 20 two-week periods, in the example of 250 participants, we would expect to give away a total of 20 × 10% × £2500 = £5000 in e-vouchers to participants, with those contributing most to load balancing receiving the highest rewards.
